# Fancy Linked List

This project contains a simple linked list which requirements are:
 + When you add a value, it has to be sorted (ascending)
 + It has to be fancy and cool. As everything I do.

## Requirements
This project has been made with Python 2.7.9 (will probably complain with Python 3.X because of the prints, and using range(x) as list!)

## Run the tests
Execute ./run_tests. PYTHON_PATH is quite annoying, this way you can run the test without issue.
### Requirements
Specified in requirements.txt (CI integration)

## Run the tests using virtualenv
To avoid installing further libraries in your machine, you can use run_virtualenv_tests.sh.
### Requirements
virtualenv
